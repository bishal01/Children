            <h2>Importance of Art in Creativity</h2>
            <p>
                Play is an important element for the development of creativity to children since it helps a child release emotions and even create images out of ideas. It assists in self-esteeem as children watch their thoughts materialize in front of them. Art teaching also another aspect of drawing since they involve mannerism such as holding tools like brush, crayons or clay. Artistic activities help children to learn more about their creativity, thinking process and try to place forms, colors and leaving on the paper. As early as in preschool years, art fosters children’s initiation, critical analysis of that which is found in the society, nonverbal expression, and a fundamental mean in child development.

            <h2>Theories and Perspectives</h2>
            <p>According to Howard Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences, Visual-Spatial Intelligence is a fundamental ability which art function strengthens by raising spatial and visual thinking. Like other approaches like the Reggio Emilia approach where children are encouraged to learn through the ‘100 languages’ among which art is considered as a great language through which children can make meanings. Both views indicate the need for integrating art into school stating that creative search develops knowledge and feelings. Apart from imagination, art activities enable the child to understand ideas, make comprehensions, interpretations, and responses to his environment in a creative way.</p>

                <li><strong>2-3 years:</strong> Many of activities which assist in shaping collages are beneficial in the development of fine motor skills.</li>
                <li><strong>3-5 years:</strong> Such murals foster teamwork and also make it possible for many students to contribute their portion of creativity.</li>
                <li><strong>6-8 years:</strong> Digital art projects involve the incorporation of the new technologies into the art projects but using the conventional methods.</li>
