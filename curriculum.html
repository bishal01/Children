        <h2>Importance of Integration</h2>
        <p>STEM and STEAM incorporates an interdisciplinary creativity these teaches children give them the chance to solve real life problems. This way the areas interrelate and a child can use knowledge from one area to the other as well as the knowledge from one area is useful in another area. This type of integration enables critical development of issues, problem solving and innovation as the children are taught how to solve entire problems with different strategies and tools. STEAM incorporates the arts in technology and sciences, explaining to the children that creativity is cross-sectional. This way children are trained to have the right balance of the world they live in and they are preparing for in the future where most problems entail one to be logical and also have the ability to think like an artist.</p>

        <h2>Theories and Perspectives</h2>
        <p>Inquiry-Based Learning by John Dewey is instrumental in understanding the paradigm upon which STEM and STEAM education stand. As for practice, Dewey thought that education processes should be based on children’s experiences, inquiring into questions, thinking through and using the findings through activities. One of the main strengths of Inquiry-Based Learning is that students are free to wonder, to search for information and to ponder over it. Moreover, there is another notion that is very connected with the approach considered: tinkering is the action of trying, probing, and adjusting. Sustained experimentation that is fostered by tinkering involves children undertaking activities that involve trial and errors in their attempt to solve problems or to fashion something. Exploration, creativity, thinking, and critical and innovative thinking are at the core of both Dewey’s theory and tinker as foundational to STEM, and STEAM education.</p>

    <section id="resources-materials">
        <h2>Resources and Tools</h2>
        <p>There are many resources and tools required for producing the STEM and STEAM environment where kids are free to explore, to discover and to create. For instance, Scratch or Code.org are websites that enable students to learn the fundamental concepts of coding and foster problem-solving and critical thinking abilities in students. Maker spaces are physical spaces which foster creativity through creation, invention, and, construction with commodities and creation tools. They may contain legos, pinewood, sensations, digital hardware such as printers sculptors, options which encourage kids to build and discover their passion. Game technology, including LEGO Mindstorms or Sphero, gives children a chance to complete engineering and technology projects including creating robots. These are not only instrumental in building technical expertise but also in communality, innovativeness, and resilience, foundations of STEM and STEAM learning.</p>

        <h2>Learning Experiences</h2>

        <div class="card" id="age-group-0-2">
            <h3>0-2 years</h3>
            <div class="activity">
                <img src="img/building bridges.jpg" alt="Building Bridges">
            </div>
            <p>I agree with the author of this article that attribute exploration is a perfect starting point to bring infants and toddlers into STEM. Pleaying with some objects with different texture, splashing with water or watching simple cause and effect relationship like shaking a rattle are useful for the development of basic sensory and scientific activities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="age-group-2-3">   
            <h3>2-3 years: </h3>
            <div class="activity">
                <img src="img/art and science.jpg" alt="Art and Science">
            </div>
            <p>Basic circuits are easy and they help the toddlers to understand some of the issues to do with electricity and energy. By observing students use conductive and non-conductive materials such as playdough, or with the use of simple batteries, students can switch on and off the lights thus beginning their instruction in engineering and critical thinking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="age-group-3-5">
            <h3>3-5 years: </h3>
            <div class="activity">
                <img src="img/story based engineering.jpg" alt="Story-Based Engineering">
            </div>
            <p>The use of kits such as LEGO or similar building construction toys enables preschool age children to appreciate aspects of engineering and robotics as they build small robots. This physical manipulation promotes manipulation skills and development of an idea, as children build their robots to do some work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" id="age-group-6-8">
            <h3>6-8 years</h3>
            <div class="activity">
                <img src="img/invent and market.jpg" alt="Invent and Market">
            </div>
            <p>When children are a little older, they can be tasked with more difficult STEM activities, like constructing a wind turbine from craft items or building simple machines. Such challenges foster purposeful, reasoned forms of decision and help students to utilize knowledge of science in practice; they also facilitate group work and exploration.</p>
